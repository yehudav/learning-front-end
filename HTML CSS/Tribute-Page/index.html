      Pizza (Italian: 'pittsa', Neapolitan: 'pittsə') is a savory dish of
      Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened
      wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other
      ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, etc.), which is
      then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.

      <h4>History</h4>
      Foods similar to pizza have been made since the Neolithic Age. Records of
      people adding other ingredients to bread to make it more flavorful can be
      found throughout ancient history. In the 6th century BC, the Persian
      soldiers of Achaemenid Empire during the rule King Darius I baked
      flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle shields and the
      ancient Greeks supplemented their bread with oils, herbs, and cheese. An
      early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the Aeneid, when Celaeno,
      queen of the Harpies, foretells that the Trojans would not find peace
      until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book
      VII, Aeneas and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes (like
      pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread, they
      realize that these are the "tables" prophesied by Celaeno. Modern pizza
      evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or
      early 19th century. Prior to that time, flatbread was often topped with
      ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, and cheese. It is uncertain when
      tomatoes were first added and there are many conflicting claims. Until
      about 1830, pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries.
      A popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza
      Margherita, was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte
      commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo (pizza maker) Raffaele Esposito to
      create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three
      different pizzas he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed
      in the colors of the Italian flag — red (tomato), green (basil), and white
      (mozzarella). Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then named after the
      Queen, although later research cast doubt on this legend. An official
      letter of recognition from the Queen's "head of service" remains on
      display in Esposito's shop, now called the Pizzeria Brandi. Pizza was
      brought to the United States with Italian immigrants in the late
      nineteenth century and first appeared in areas where Italian immigrants
      concentrated. The country's first pizzeria, Lombardi's, opened in 1905.
      Following World War II, veterans returning from the Italian Campaign, who
      were introduced to Italy's native cuisine, proved a ready market for pizza
      in particular.
