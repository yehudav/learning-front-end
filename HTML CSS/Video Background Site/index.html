      <h1>Computer keyboard</h1>
      A computer keyboard is a typewriter-style device[1] which uses an
      arrangement of buttons or keys to act as mechanical levers or electronic
      switches. Replacing early punched cards and paper tape technology,
      interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards have been the main input
      method for computers since the 1970s, supplemented by the computer mouse
      since the 1980s. Keyboard keys (buttons) typically have a set of
      characters engraved or printed on them, and each press of a key typically
      corresponds to a single written symbol. However, producing some symbols
      may require pressing and holding several keys simultaneously or in
      sequence.[2] While most keyboard keys produce letters, numbers or symbols
      (characters), other keys or simultaneous key presses can prompt the
      computer to execute system commands, such as such as the
      Control-Alt-Delete combination used with Microsoft Windows.[3][4] In a
      modern computer, the interpretation of key presses is generally left to
      the software: the information sent to the computer, the scan code, tells
      it only which key (or keys) on which row and column, was pressed or
      released.[5] In normal usage, the keyboard is used as a text entry
      interface for typing text, numbers, and symbols into application software
      such as a word processor, web browser or social media app.
